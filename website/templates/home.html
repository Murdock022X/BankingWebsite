    <h2 class="subtitle">Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      This project is an attempt to recreate a simple banking application. It is 
      completely fake, and does not use real currency. Rather the website simply 
      allows you to carry out many of the functions you might see on a banking 
      website. For example the project allows you to:
      <ul>
        <li>Create an account.</li>
        <li>Close an account.</li>
        <li>View a graph that shows the balance history of an account.</li>
        <li>Withdraw, deposit, and transfer funds into and from accounts.</li>
        <li>See messages and alerts from admins.</li>
        <li>The application also automatically generates E-Statement PDFs for your account during a term (one week).</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Git Command Line Essentials</li>
        <li>Flask: This was my first exposure to web applications and flask was an excellent framework for helping me learn fundamentals including:
          <ul>
            <li>Web Routes</li>
            <li>Get and Post</li>
            <li>Web Structure</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Flask-Login: A flask addon module used to easily log users in and out.</li>
        <li>Flask-Sqlalchemy: A flask addon module used to easily connect to, query, and alter data in an SQL database.</li>
        <li>Flask-Wtforms: A flask addon module that allowed me to easily create forms that performed checks and prevented csrf attacks.</li>
        <li>SQL: This was also my first exposure to SQL and databases in general. I learned how to:
          <ul>
            <li>Connect to, query, and alter data in an SQL database using both the default command line for MySQL and sqlite3, as well as using the python connector, and Flask-SQLAlchemy as previously mentioned.</li>
            <li>Create tables.</li>
            <li>Experienced MySQL before switching to sqlite3 for this project.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Javascript: I was required to write a little bit of javascript during this project, I am not proficient with javascript at this point but I am familiar.</li>
        <li>Chart.js: I used a javascript library called Chart.js to create a graph on a webpage that displayed balance history. I learned:
          <ul>
            <li>Basic javascript syntax and how it mirrors that of JSON.</li>
            <li>How to retrieve information from a url using the javascript fetch command.</li>
            <li>How to serialize information from python into json format and give it to javascript.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>PyFPDF2: A python library I used to generate the E-Statement Pdfs.</li>
        <li>Json: I had not worked with json file formats before, and I became completely comfortable with the json format during this project.</li>
        <li>Module structure: I learned how to make the python interpreter see folders and files as modules and submodules in python, creating an __init__ file and accessing that module.</li>
        <li>Server Setup: I learned how to setup and configure a web hosting server:
          <ul>
            <li>Getting a domain name.</li>
            <li>Getting an SSL certificate and setting up https.</li>
            <li>Used Nginx to serve static files on the website.</li>
            <li>Used gunicorn to run the flask application.</li>
            <li>Used UNIX supervisor to ensure gunicorn was always running on the server.</li>
            <li>Used UNIX crontabs to set jobs to be executed at certain times.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
